"""Structural detection of contamination in a reconstructed ancestor.

Marginal ASR infers every site independently, so a reconstruction stitched from
two incompatible histories is invisible to per-site diagnostics: each site is
individually well supported. The pathology is joint.

ProteinMPNN's decoder is a joint-compatibility model — it scores a residue given
the *other residues* and the backbone — so it can see what marginal posteriors
cannot. Two probes, both built on decoding-order control from [mpnn_api]:

**Context swap.** Reconstruct the two candidate sub-histories separately (the two
clades of the stemma) and ask, for each site of the mosaic ancestor,

    delta_i = log p(a_i | context = ancestor_A) - log p(a_i | context = ancestor_B)

A coherent ancestor gives delta ~ 0 with no spatial structure: its residues are
equally at home in either context because the contexts barely differ. A
contaminated ancestor gives a *contiguous run* of sites that prefer one context
and a complementary run that prefers the other. The breakpoint is where the sign
flips.

**Order instability.** Decode the ancestor under many random decoding orders and
measure how much site i's preferred residue depends on which neighbours happened
to be filled in first. A residue that is plausible given lineage-A neighbours and
implausible given lineage-B neighbours flips; a coherent site does not.

Significance comes from a permutation test that destroys spatial contiguity while
preserving the marginal distribution of delta — so the null is "these per-site
scores, arranged at random", and what gets tested is the segmental structure that
contamination produces and ordinary functional coupling does not.

    to resolve that before per-site scores can be ranked, and it must not be the
    ground truth — orienting by the labels would score a coin flip as skill.

    Two label-free rules were measured (`sweeps.py --sweep orientation`):

      minority  the intrusion is the rarer sign among diagnostic sites. This
                fails, because outside the intruding block the mosaic ancestor
                is genuinely intermediate between the two clades: delta there is
                ~0 with essentially random sign, so the "majority" is decided by

      segment   the intrusion is the window the scan already flagged. This is
                the detector's own output, so it costs no extra information, and
                it gave AUC 0.95 on that same run.

    The `segment` rule is used. It is not circular: the window is the detector's
    *estimate*, and when that estimate is wrong the AUC lands below 0.5 rather
    than being rescued — which is what makes the number falsifiable.
