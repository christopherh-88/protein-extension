    <h1>Contaminated ancestors</h1>
    <p class="lede prose">
      The hardest problem in stemmatics is not building a family tree of manuscripts — it is
      contamination. A scribe with two exemplars copies from both, and the resulting witness has
      no single parent. Ancestral sequence reconstruction has the same failure mode and no
      equivalent alarm: recombination makes the tree assumption false, and maximum-likelihood ASR
      responds by returning a chimeric ancestor with high per-site posteriors. Every site is
      individually fine. The pathology is joint, and every standard diagnostic is marginal.
    </p>
    <p class="lede prose">
      ProteinMPNN's decoder scores each residue given the other residues and the backbone, which
      makes it a joint-compatibility model rather than a decorative one. Fix its decoding order
      and you can ask a site whether it prefers one lineage's neighbours to the other's.

    <h2>What is not established</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Detection is inconsistent.</b> On epistatic data the detector fires on some
        conditions and not others. The clean hits are strong; the misses track families with
        too few diagnostic sites.</li>
      <li><b>Short segments are out of reach.</b> A 10-residue swap gives an AUC near chance,
        against roughly 0.87 for a 30-residue swap. Detection needs a block long enough to
        contain enough informative sites.</li>
      <li><b>The repair prediction is unsupported so far.</b> The mosaic was expected to score
        worse than either coherent sub-ancestor, with the gap widening as contamination rises.
        Measured gaps are small and do not scale.</li>
      <li><b>The simulation assumes what the detector senses.</b> The epistatic simulator draws
        from ProteinMPNN's own joint distribution. The f81 control is what keeps this honest;
        a real protein family is what would settle it.</li>
      <li><b>Everything here is in silico</b>, on one backbone, with stability as a
        pseudo-log-likelihood proxy rather than a measured &Delta;&Delta;G.</li>
